the joys of coding is an adobe edge animation.

it doesn't do anything appart from displaying very little svg drawings which i stole of someone. i have no idea from whome so if you're the author please drop me a line and i'll be happy to paste your name all over the comp.   

in the meantime even links to social plugins aren't working but there is original EgAn file so you are very welcome to fix them and add yourself here.
